# PALINDROME CHECKER - LinkedStackProject
## The goal of this project is to determine whether a word is a palindrome (a linear collection of objects that appear to be in the same order when you list them in either direction) by utilizing stacks

PalindromeChecker.java uses 2 stacks to determine if a string is a palindrome where an input string is read as a command-line argument and is checked for the palindrome property. When there is no args[0], the program prints a message and continues executing.
